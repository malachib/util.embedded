# Experimental code ONLY

Only modify code in this folder when on the 'experimental' branch, and
*never* merge this branch back to main.  Instead, on a non-experimental
branch, copy/paste the now-proven code into a proper non-experimental area

Expect:

* Breaking changes, routinely
* Incomplete features
